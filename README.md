# Fun with Linq and IEnumerble

A fun project inspired from bugs in production code.

We have a ```Point``` representing a point in a 2D grid. We can "move up" the point by incrementing its y coordinate by 1.

The intent of the program is to instantiate 10 points and instruct them to move up.

Question 1:

Does the original program behaves as expected ? Could you explain the actual behavior ?

Question 2:

Could you propose different ways to fix the issue ?
